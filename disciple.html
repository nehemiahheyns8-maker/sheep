    <h2>What is a Disciple?</h2>
    <p>
      A disciple is a <strong>follower of Jesus Christ</strong> — not just by name, but by lifestyle.
      Jesus said: <em>“If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.”</em> (Luke 9:23).
      A disciple learns from Christ and lives like Christ, showing His love to others.
    </p>

    <h2>The Purpose of a Disciple</h2>
    <p>
      • To love God with all their heart, soul, and mind (<strong>Matthew 22:37</strong>).<br>
      • To love others as Christ has loved us (<strong>John 13:34</strong>).<br>
      • To go into the world and make disciples of all nations (<strong>Matthew 28:19–20</strong>).<br>
      • To shine as a light in a dark world (<strong>Matthew 5:14–16</strong>).
    </p>

    <h2>Encouragement</h2>
    <p>
      Being a disciple has nothing to do with age, status, or wealth. Whether <strong>young or old, weak or strong</strong>,
      every believer is called to follow Jesus and bring others to Him.
      You can start by showing kindness, sharing the Gospel, or simply living in a way that reflects Christ.
