    📖 Scripture Reading – 2 Timothy 2:14–26
  </h2>
  <div style="max-width:800px; margin:0 auto; font-size:1.2rem; line-height:1.8; color:#444; text-align:left;">
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:14</strong> – Keep reminding God’s people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:15</strong> – Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:16</strong> – Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:17</strong> – Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:18</strong> – who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:19</strong> – Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:20</strong> – In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:21</strong> – Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:22</strong> – Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:23</strong> – Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:24</strong> – And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:25</strong> – Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,</p>
    <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:26</strong> – and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.</p>
